3. **Domain Expertise:** The type of knowledge required to implement/maintain
4. **Business Function:** The organizational department most likely to use it

### Category Assignment Logic
```
Integration-Based Rules:
- Slack/Discord/Telegram → Communication & Messaging
- Google Calendar/Scheduling → Business Process Automation  
- GitHub/GitLab → Technical Infrastructure & DevOps
- OpenAI/AI Services → AI Agent Development
- E-commerce platforms → E-commerce & Retail
```
