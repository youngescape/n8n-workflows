Your task is to extract structured information about the call, including use cases, objections, summaries, and other relevant insights for the marketing team at n8n. Pay close attention to action-oriented language and specific requests made by the external participants.\n\n\n1. **Marketing Insights**: Summarize any marketing-related insights from the external speaker, organized by specific tags that correspond to different areas of marketing focus (e.g., website work, workflow templates, video content, community forum). Each piece of insight should include a Tag field with the specific marketing area and a Summary field that provides a brief description of the insight. Only use the below list of tags when creating insights and ensure the insight is specific to insights from the list below. For example do not give pricing insight for marketing insights. If no marketing insights that match the tags below are not found, output an empty array. Please do not output any tags that are not defined below in the numbered list. Include relevant quotes from the transcript to explain why the marketing tag is relevant in the summary output.\nTags:\n1. **Landing Page Opportunity**: Indicates a need for a new or improved landing page targeting a specific enterprise demographic. For example, if a prospect mentions needing more detailed information about security or scalability, this could prompt the creation of a dedicated landing page.\n2. **Workflow Template Request**: Indicates a specific workflow template that a prospect or customer would find helpful. This could be based on mentions of repetitive tasks or automation needs that aren't yet covered by your existing templates.\n3. **Video Tutorial Request**: Prospects asking for video tutorials or walkthroughs on how to set up specific workflows, integrations, or advanced features.\n4. **Feature Explanation**: Indicates a need for video or text based content explaining the benefits or setup of specific n8n features. For example, if a prospect doesn’t understand how the HTTP request node works, a video or blog post could be created to explain this.\n5. **Success Story Request**: Prospects interested in seeing content showcasing how other companies have successfully implemented n8n. Try to include details in the summary of what success looks like for the external speaker.\n6. **Customer Success Story**: Stories that the external speaker gave of success they have found using the n8n platform. In the summary include any direct quotes taken from the transcript about this story.\n7. **FAQ Gap**: Questions or concerns raised during calls that are not covered or easily found in the existing forum FAQ or website.\n8. **Event/Conference Mention**: Capture mentions of events, conferences, or industry meetups where n8n could have a presence. Try to get name, location, and date if possible from the transcript.\n9. **Brand Advocate Potential**: Identify prospects who sound excited or enthusiastic about using n8n and could become brand advocates. Use this to prioritize follow-ups for case studies, testimonials, or involvement in community events. It could also inform who to reach out to for co-marketing opportunities.\n9. **Documentation Gap**: Use this tag anytime an external speaker mentions a lack or frustration with the n8n documentation pages, and any suggestions to improve them. Include the suggestion in the summary if mentioned.\nA. Expected example Format: \"MarketingInsights\": [\n{\n\"Tag\": \"Landing Page Opportunity\",\n\"Summary\": \"The prospect mentioned wanting more information about data security, suggesting a need for a dedicated landing page on security features.\"\n},\n{\n\"Tag\": \"WorkFlow Template Request\",\n\"Summary\": \"The external speaker asked if there was a workflow template for automating CRM data entry.\"\n}\n]\nB.

Marketing Insights: Keyword and Topic Analysis**\n\nAnalyze the call transcript to identify recurring topics or phrases that were mentioned multiple times by the external speaker or other participants. This analysis will be used to match recurring topics with keyword volume data and adapt **n8n's** blog content accordingly.\n\n1. **Identify Recurring Topics or Phrases**:\n   - Extract key topics, phrases, or keywords mentioned more than once during the call.\n   - Focus on phrases related to:\n     - Pain points or challenges.\n     - Desired features or solutions.\n     - Industry-specific terminology.\n     - Automation goals or use case ideas.\n\n2. **Provide a Frequency Analysis**:\n   - Rank the identified topics or phrases by the number of times they were mentioned during the call.\n   - Group similar phrases under a unified topic if they are variations of the same concept (e.g., \"CRM integration\" and \"integrating with CRM\").\n\n3. **Include Context**:\n   - For each topic or phrase, summarize its context within the conversation. Example contexts could include:\n     - Pain points the topic addresses.\n     - Solutions or workflows discussed.\n     - Broader goals or industry-specific needs.\n\n4. **Output Format**:\n   - **Recurring Topics**:\n     ```json\n     {\n         \"RecurringTopics\": [\n             {\n                 \"Topic\": \"Data Security\",\n                 \"Mentions\": 5,\n                 \"Context\": \"Discussed in relation to GDPR compliance and secure integrations with cloud platforms.\"\n             },\n             {\n                 \"Topic\": \"Customer Support Automation\",\n                 \"Mentions\": 3,\n                 \"Context\": \"Focused on improving ticket resolution times through automated workflows.\"\n             },\n             {\n                 \"Topic\": \"CRM Integration\",\n                 \"Mentions\": 2,\n                 \"Context\": \"Talked about syncing Salesforce data with email campaigns.\"\n             }\n         ]\n     }\n     ```\n\nIf there are no recurring topics, use this output format: \n     ```json\n     {\n         \"RecurringTopics\": []\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - **Actionable Insights**:\n     ```json\n     {\n         \"ActionableInsights\": [\n             {\n                 \"RecommendationType\": \"Blog Post\",\n                 \"Title\": \"Top 5 Ways to Ensure Data Security in Workflow Automation\",\n                 \"Topic\": \"Data Security\",\n                 \"Rationale\": \"Data security was mentioned frequently in the context of compliance and cloud integrations, indicating high interest.\"\n             },\n             {\n                 \"RecommendationType\": \"Tutorial\",\n                 \"Title\": \"How to Automate Customer Support with n8n\",\n                 \"Topic\": \"Customer Support Automation\",\n                 \"Rationale\": \"Customer support automation was discussed as a key challenge, suggesting value in a step-by-step guide.\"\n             },\n             {\n                 \"RecommendationType\": \"Marketing Campaign\",\n                 \"Title\": \"CRM Integration as a Cornerstone for Workflow Automation\",\n                 \"Topic\": \"CRM Integration\",\n                 \"Rationale\": \"CRM integration was highlighted as a critical feature, making it a strong focus for targeted marketing campaigns.\"\n             }\n         ]\n     }\n     ```\n\nIf there are no actionable insights, use the following output format: \n\n     ```json\n     {\n         \"ActionableInsights\": []\n     }\n     ```\n\n---\n"

Competitors**\n**Prompt**:  \nList out any competitors the external speaker may be considering or has used instead of n8n. Do not output n8n. Separate these into two categories: **Used** and **Considering**. For each competitor, include the **Name**, a **Reason** summarizing why they are using or considering the competitor, a **Known** boolean field indicating if the competitor is part of a provided known list, and a **Pricing** field to capture any pricing details mentioned. **Details for Each Category**:\n\n- **Used**: List competitors that the external speaker has previously used. Include details about the purpose or reason for using these competitors, such as \"better integrations,\" \"better support,\" or \"specific features.\"\n- **Considering**: List competitors the external speaker is currently evaluating as alternatives to n8n. Include any details provided about why these competitors are being considered, such as \"scalability,\" \"cost-effectiveness,\" or \"existing familiarity.\"\n- **Known Competitor List**: Reference the following known list to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with transcription issues or unusual company names: {{ $json.metaData.Competitors }} Only include a competitor if language is used to that suggests that they are comparing the competitor to n8n or language is used that suggests that it is a better match than n8n or being evaluated against n8n. \n- - If a competitor matches one from the known list, set **Known** to `true` and output the name exactly as it is in the list above. If it is not on the list, set **Known** to `false` and output the company name as output. If they do not mention the name of the competitor but allude to one, output the name \"Unknown\" as the name of the compeitor. \n- **Pricing**: Capture any pricing information mentioned about the competitor. This may include specific price points, subscription plans, or cost comparisons. If no pricing information is found, set **Pricing** to `null`.\n- **Sentiment**: Capture the sentiment of the external speaker towards the competitor using one of three options, \"n8n better\",\"n8n worse\", \"Unknown\". Include the reason for choosing sentiment in \"Reason\" with quotes from transcript or if not reasoning for choosing that sentiment. \"n8n better\" should be used where language is used to denote that they find n8n's features better than the competitor. \"n8n worse\" should be used where language is used to denote that they find the competitors features better equipped to handle their use case. Use \"Unknown\" if they do not have sentiment one way or another regarding the competitor.   \n\n**Expected JSON Output Format**:\n```json\n{\n  \"Competitors\": [\n    {\n      \"Tag\": \"Used or Considering\",\n      \"Name\": \"Competitor Name\",\n      \"Reason\": \"Reason for using or considering this competitor.\",\n      \"Known\": true,\n      \"Pricing\": \"Pricing details or null if not mentioned.\",\n      \"Sentiment\": \"n8n better, n8n worse, or Unknown\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Fallback** (If no competitors mentioned):  \n```json\n{\n  \"Competitors\": []\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **7. Integrations**\n**Prompt**:  \nList any software the external speaker mentions they either currently use or want to integrate with n8n, along with the context or reason for the integration if specified. Do not comma separate the integration names, and simplify just to the name of the integration. Focus on specific integrations named on the call and avoid general or vague terms. Reference the provided comma separated list of native nodes from our database to determine if the integration is natively supported. List of current Integrations: {{ $json.metaData.Integrations }}. Only include an integration if language is used to that suggests that they are trying to deploy or integrate with n8n or have in the past. Do not use general terms for integrations, please use company names. Include tags for the integration status and usage status. Transcription Analysis Tip: If the external speaker mentions they are currently using an integration through the HTTP request node but express a desire for a dedicated node, classify the IntegrationStatus as \"Not Integrated\" and the UsageStatus as \"Currently Using.\" This indicates that they are using a workaround and would prefer native support.\n\n- Explanation of Fields\n- - **IntegrationName**: The simplified name of the software mentioned. If the Integration is in the comma separated list above, use the exact name in the comma separated list as the IntegrationName.\n- - **SummaryOfUse**: A brief description of how the external speaker wants to use or integrate the software with n8n, including mention of using the **HTTP request node** if applicable.\n- - **IntegrationStatus**: Use \"Currently Integrated\" if the integration is natively supported by n8n by checking the comma separated List of current Integrations above, and \"Not Integrated\" if it is not in the list above. \n- - **UsageStatus**: Use \"Currently Using\" if the external speaker is actively using the integration (including via the HTTP request node), and \"Want to Use\" if they are only considering or planning to use it.\n\n**Expected JSON Output Format**:\n```json\n{\n  \"Integrations\": [\n    {\n      \"IntegrationName\": \"Integration Name\",\n      \"SummaryOfUse\": \"Brief description of the integration use case.\",\n      \"IntegrationStatus\": \"Currently Integrated or Not Integrated\",\n      \"UsageStatus\": \"Currently Using or Want to Use\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Fallback** (If no integrations mentioned):  \n```json\n{\n  \"Integrations\": []\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **8. Sentiment**\n**Prompt**:  \nDetermine the overall sentiment of the external speaker throughout the call. It should be categorized as one of \"Positive,\" \"Neutral,\" or \"Negative\" based on their feedback, objections, and tone. \n- **Positive**: The external speaker shows genuine interest in the n8n platform, discusses clear and actionable next steps, or uses enthusiastic language. Look for phrases that indicate excitement or satisfaction, such as \"this is great,\" \"we're looking forward to,\" or \"this could really help us.\" \n- **Neutral**: The external speaker neither expresses strong enthusiasm nor significant concerns. They may use language that indicates a wait-and-see approach, such as \"let's explore this further\" or \"we need more information.\" The call may end with some uncertainty, but without outright dismissal and with specific plans to meet again. \n- **Negative**: The external speaker expresses significant concerns or reluctance about using n8n. Indicators include phrases like \"not a fit,\" \"not a fit right now,\" or discussion about taking the information away and \"following up if we need more information in the future/down the line.\" Negative sentiment can also be inferred if the call ends without any clear next steps.\n\n**Expected JSON Output Format**:\n```json\n{\n  \"Sentiment\": \"Positive, Neutral, or Negative\"\n}\n```\n\n**Fallback**:  \n```json\n{\n  \"Sentiment\": \"Neutral\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **9.
